== Setting Default Parameters

One of the benefits of packages is the ability to define default parameters that can be automatically applied to actions. In the iot-serverless package that was created in the prior section, the formatInput action takes in two parameters, the name of the topic for which messages will be received from (topic) and a single string consisting of the latitude and longitude. When invoking the action, we could specify the parameters explicitly as done previously, or define them globally within the package.
