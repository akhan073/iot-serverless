== Setting Default Parameters

One of the benefits of packages is the ability to define default parameters that can be automatically applied to actions. In the iot-serverless package that was created in the prior section, the formatInput action takes in two parameters, the name of the topic for which messages will be received from (topic) and a single string consisting of the latitude and longitude. When invoking the action, we could specify the parameters explicitly as done previously, or define them globally within the package.

== Customizing GUI

The GUI for this lab uses link:https://www.patternfly.org/[PatternFly], an open source UI framework for enterprise web applications.
The GUI design uses the sample code from link:http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/navigation/vertical-navigation/#overview[Vertical Navigation] template.

You can install PatternFly on your local system and easily build amazing UIs. Visit link:https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly[PatternFly Github Repo] for details.
